Here is the **GitHub README** file for your AI project based on the provided files:  
 🚀 AI Agent System using Crew AI  

📌 Overview  
This project leverages **Crew AI** to create an AI-driven **multi-agent system** capable of performing automated tasks using **LLMs** and specialized tools. The AI agents collaborate to provide information, solve mathematical equations, and generate detailed explanations.  

🔥 Features  
Multi-Agent Collaboration – AI agents work together to complete complex tasks.  
Task Automation – Automates research, math calculations, and content generation.  
LLM Integration – Supports OpenAI GPT and LocalAI models (Phi-3, etc.).  
Custom Tool Integration – Includes a Calculator Tool for solving equations.  
Environment Variable Support – Uses `.env` for API keys and configurations.  

🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Crew AI – Multi-agent framework  
- LangChain & OpenAI API – LLM-powered responses  
- LocalAI – Runs models locally (Ollama)  
- dotenv – Loads environment variables  

🚀 Installation & Setup  
1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Crew-Agent.git
cd AI-Crew-Agent

2️⃣ Install Dependencies  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Set Up API Keys  
- Create a `.env` file with the following content:  
```sh
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

4️⃣ Run the Main AI Agent
For OpenAI-powered AI Agent:
```sh
python main.py
```
For LocalAI (Ollama-based) model:
```sh
python main-ollama-localai.py
```
For Math AI Agent (includes calculator tools):
```sh
python tools-example.py
```

⚡ Use Cases  
- Information Retrieval – AI agent provides detailed topic explanations.  
- Math Solving – AI evaluates equations and generates explanations.  
- Content Generation – AI agents create structured written reports.
